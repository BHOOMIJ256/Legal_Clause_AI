All capitalized terms defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in this SOW.\nStatement of Work (SOW) for CASB Tool\nProblem Statement:\nVisibility and Control: Gaining comprehensive visibility Endpoint and enforcing security policies consistently across Network and third party Applications.\nThreat Detection and Response: Detecting and responding to endpoint-specific security threats, including insider threats, malware, Ransomwaresand account compromises.\nCompliance Adherence: XDR will aid in meeting compliance requirements by providing centralized visibility and enabling efficient reporting and audit trails.\nResource Consumption: Antivirus scans can be resource-intensive, impacting system performance during scans, updates, and real-time protection, sometimes leading to slowdowns or compatibility issues with other software.\nPrevention Against Zero-day attacks: Identifying and mitigating threats for which there are no known signatures or patterns, thereby requiring advanced heuristics and behaviour-based analysis.\nBusiness Objective:\nThe primary business objective of implementing a Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution to enhance Endpoint security. XDR solution will provide a more comprehensive view of our endpoint security posture by collecting data from multiple sources, such as endpoints, network devices, and cloud services, and then using that data to detect and respond to threats.\nCertainly, here are some key business objectives associated with implementing a XDR:\nMeeting Client RFP\u2019s: Client RFPs increasingly emphasize the need for a unified security solution capable of providing end-to-end threat visibility and response capabilities across diverse platforms. This necessitates the implementation of an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) system to fulfil these requirements.\nHolistic Threat Detection: Traditional security tools often operate in silos, which hinders the ability to detect and respond to sophisticated, multi-vector cyber threats effectively. XDR addresses this by aggregating and correlating data from various security layers, offering a more comprehensive view of potential threats across an organization\u2019s entire IT environment.\nEfficient Incident Response: There\u2019s a growing need for faster and more efficient incident response capabilities. XDR provides a unified platform that streamlines the detection, investigation, and response to security incidents, reducing the mean time to detect and respond (MTTD/MTTR) significantly. \nRegulatory Compliance and Risk Mitigation: With the capability to aggregate, analyze, and report security data, XDR supports businesses in meeting compliance standards across different regulatory frameworks. By offering a centralized view and aiding in audit trails and reporting, XDR contributes to minimizing risks associated with non-compliance.

All capitalized terms defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in this SOW.\nStatement of Work (SOW) for CASB Tool\nProblem Statement:\nVisibility and Control: Gaining comprehensive visibility Endpoint and enforcing security policies consistently across Network and third party Applications.\nThreat Detection and Response: Detecting and responding to endpoint-specific security threats, including insider threats, malware, Ransomwaresand account compromises.\nCompliance Adherence: XDR will aid in meeting compliance requirements by providing centralized visibility and enabling efficient reporting and audit trails.\nResource Consumption: Antivirus scans can be resource-intensive, impacting system performance during scans, updates, and real-time protection, sometimes leading to slowdowns or compatibility issues with other software.\nPrevention Against Zero-day attacks: Identifying and mitigating threats for which there are no known signatures or patterns, thereby requiring advanced heuristics and behaviour-based analysis.\nBusiness Objective:\nThe primary business objective of implementing a Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution to enhance Endpoint security. XDR solution will provide a more comprehensive view of our endpoint security posture by collecting data from multiple sources, such as endpoints, network devices, and cloud services, and then using that data to detect and respond to threats.\nCertainly, here are some key business objectives associated with implementing a XDR:\nMeeting Client RFP\u2019s: Client RFPs increasingly emphasize the need for a unified security solution capable of providing end-to-end threat visibility and response capabilities across diverse platforms. This necessitates the implementation of an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) system to fulfil these requirements.\nHolistic Threat Detection: Traditional security tools often operate in silos, which hinders the ability to detect and respond to sophisticated, multi-vector cyber threats effectively. XDR addresses this by aggregating and correlating data from various security layers, offering a more comprehensive view of potential threats across an organization\u2019s entire IT environment.\nEfficient Incident Response: There\u2019s a growing need for faster and more efficient incident response capabilities. XDR provides a unified platform that streamlines the detection, investigation, and response to security incidents, reducing the mean time to detect and respond (MTTD/MTTR) significantly. \nRegulatory Compliance and Risk Mitigation: With the capability to aggregate, analyze, and report security data, XDR supports businesses in meeting compliance standards across different regulatory frameworks. By offering a centralized view and aiding in audit trails and reporting, XDR contributes to minimizing risks associated with non-compliance. This use case ensures that businesses maintain a robust security posture while meeting regulatory requirements, reducing the possibility of fines and reputational damage due to non-compliance.\nCurrent Use Case\nProject Overview\nThis Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the scope of work and deliverables for the implementation of XDR tool at Sirion Labs.

        "This Statement of Work (\u201cSOW\u201d) dated ______ (\u201cSOW Effective Date\u201d) is made part of the Master Service Agreement executed between Softcell Global Technologies Private Limited (the Service Provider) and ___________________ (the Customer) dated____________ (\u201cAgreement\u201d). In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the terms of this SOW, the terms of the Agreement shall prevail.  \nAll capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. All capitalized terms defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in this SOW.\nStatement of Work (SOW) for CASB Tool\nProblem Statement:\nVisibility and Control: Gaining comprehensive visibility Endpoint and enforcing security policies consistently across Network and third party Applications.\nThreat Detection and Response: Detecting and responding to endpoint-specific security threats, including insider threats, malware, Ransomwaresand account compromises.\nCompliance Adherence: XDR will aid in meeting compliance requirements by providing centralized visibility and enabling efficient reporting and audit trails.\nResource Consumption: Antivirus scans can be resource-intensive, impacting system performance during scans, updates, and real-time protection, sometimes leading to slowdowns or compatibility issues with other software.\nPrevention Against Zero-day attacks: Identifying and mitigating threats for which there are no known signatures or patterns, thereby requiring advanced heuristics and behaviour-based analysis.\nBusiness Objective:\nThe primary business objective of implementing a Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution to enhance Endpoint security. XDR solution will provide a more comprehensive view of our endpoint security posture by collecting data from multiple sources, such as endpoints, network devices, and cloud services, and then using that data to detect and respond to threats.\nCertainly, here are some key business objectives associated with implementing a XDR:\nMeeting Client RFP\u2019s: Client RFPs increasingly emphasize the need for a unified security solution capable of providing end-to-end threat visibility and response capabilities across diverse platforms. This necessitates the implementation of an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) system to fulfil these requirements.\nHolistic Threat Detection: Traditional security tools often operate in silos, which hinders the ability to detect and respond to sophisticated, multi-vector cyber threats effectively. XDR addresses this by aggregating and correlating data from various security layers, offering a more comprehensive view of potential threats across an organization\u2019s entire IT environment.\nEfficient Incident Response: There\u2019s a growing need for faster and more efficient incident response capabilities. XDR provides a unified platform that streamlines the detection, investigation, and response to security incidents, reducing the mean time to detect and respond (MTTD/MTTR) significantly. \nRegulatory Compliance and Risk Mitigation: With the capability to aggregate, analyze, and report security data, XDR supports businesses in meeting compliance standards across different regulatory frameworks. By offering a centralized view and aiding in audit trails and reporting, XDR contributes to minimizing risks associated with non-compliance. This use case ensures that businesses maintain a robust security posture while meeting regulatory requirements, reducing the possibility of fines and reputational damage due to non-compliance.\nCurrent Use Case\nProject Overview\nThis Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the scope of work and deliverables for the implementation of XDR tool at Sirion Labs.
