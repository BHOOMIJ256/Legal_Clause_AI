Absence of such notification means that the Opportunity has not been accepted by OutSystems.\nPursuit of Accepted Opportunities. Upon acceptance of the Opportunity, the Channel Partner is expected to continue to engage with the Prospect to further promote OutSystems and the Product to the Prospect. Channel Partner agrees to work collaboratively with OutSystems at all times and, where requested by OutSystems, Channel Partner agrees to work the an OutSystems representative. Unless otherwise explicitly requested by Channel Partner, and confirmed by OutSystems, every Opportunity referral shall be deemed non-exclusive. Under certain circumstances, a Channel Partner may request exclusivity for a specific opportunity referral, and OutSystems reserves the right to extend exclusivity to the Opportunity referral. In the event that exclusivity of Opportunity is granted to Channel Partner, the exclusivity of the Opportunity referral will be for the duration of the Validity Period. Such exclusivity means that OutSystems agrees to pursue Software license sales in cooperation with Channel Partner and agrees not to accept Opportunity referrals from any other Channel Partner, except in the case of a public open tender or upon written request by Prospect to either Party.\nOpportunities Outside of Territory. In the event a Channel Partner finds an Opportunity to refer a Prospect outside of the Channel Partner\u2019s defined Territory, Channel Partner must obtain OutSystems\u2019 prior written consent to engage with such a Prospect through an Accepted Opportunity registration. Channel Partner acknowledges that, in such a case, specific rules of the applicable Territory and/or OutSystems specific guidelines and directions shall apply and supersede any conflicting terms of this Agreement.\nBecoming an End-Customer. If the Prospect of an Accepted Opportunity has: (a) not previously entered into an agreement with OutSystems; (b) not previously been accepted by OutSystems as an Accepted Opportunity being referred or introduced to OutSystems by any other person, entity or Channel Partner or directly engaged by OutSystems; and (c) not previously been documented as an End-Customer (as defined above); and (d) OutSystems finally enters into an agreement with the Prospect of such Accepted Opportunity, this Prospect shall be considered an End-Customer for the purposes of this Agreement and OutSystems shall pay the Partner Commission to Channel Partner as set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement and in accordance with the Channel Partner Program. End-Customers who (i) acquire a Subscription through an assignment or migration of an existing Subscription or (ii) purchase the Subscription through an Independent Software Vendor, shall not be considered as a new End-Customer and Channel Partner shall not be entitled to a Partner Commission.\nDispute of Referrals. In the event a referral of an Opportunity is registered by two or more Channel Partners, finders or other persons, OutSystems, in its sole discretion, shall determine which party is entitled to a fee, if any, based primarily upon each party\u2019s contribution.\nChannel Partner\u2019s Warranties. Channel Partner warrants and represents that, for each Opportunity referred to OutSystems under this Agreement, Channel Partner has the authority to make the referral on behalf of the Prospect, and that neither Channel Partner, nor any of its directors, officers, or shareholders have a conflict of interests with the Prospect or with OutSystems or is in breach of any applicable policies in making the referral.\nOutSystems Rights. Other than rights granted herein, Channel Partner acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit OutSystems from marketing and selling its Product, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, in the Territory or outside the Territory, to any prospective customers, or from working with other representatives, resellers, distributors or other marketing agents, without any liability to Channel Partner."

      "text": "This Statement of Work (\u201cSOW\u201d) dated ______ (\u201cSOW Effective Date\u201d) is made part of the Master Service Agreement executed between Softcell Global Technologies Private Limited (the Service Provider) and ___________________ (the Customer) dated____________ (\u201cAgreement\u201d). In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the terms of this SOW, the terms of the Agreement shall prevail.  \nAll capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. All capitalized terms defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in this SOW.\nStatement of Work (SOW) for CASB Tool\nProblem Statement:\nVisibility and Control: Gaining comprehensive visibility Endpoint and enforcing security policies consistently across Network and third party Applications.\nThreat Detection and Response: Detecting and responding to endpoint-specific security threats, including insider threats, malware, Ransomwaresand account compromises.\nCompliance Adherence: XDR will aid in meeting compliance requirements by providing centralized visibility and enabling efficient reporting and audit trails.\nResource Consumption: Antivirus scans can be resource-intensive, impacting system performance during scans, updates, and real-time protection, sometimes leading to slowdowns or compatibility issues with other software.\nPrevention Against Zero-day attacks: Identifying and mitigating threats for which there are no known signatures or patterns, thereby requiring advanced heuristics and behaviour-based analysis.\nBusiness Objective:\nThe primary business objective of implementing a Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution to enhance Endpoint security. XDR solution will provide a more comprehensive view of our endpoint security posture by collecting data from multiple sources, such as endpoints, network devices, and cloud services, and then using that data to detect and respond to threats.\nCertainly, here are some key business objectives associated with implementing a XDR:\nMeeting Client RFP\u2019s: Client RFPs increasingly emphasize the need for a unified security solution capable of providing end-to-end threat visibility and response capabilities across diverse platforms. This necessitates the implementation of an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) system to fulfil these requirements.\nHolistic Threat Detection: Traditional security tools often operate in silos, which hinders the ability to detect and respond to sophisticated, multi-vector cyber threats effectively. XDR addresses this by aggregating and correlating data from various security layers, offering a more comprehensive view of potential threats across an organization\u2019s entire IT environment.\nEfficient Incident Response: There\u2019s a growing need for faster and more efficient incident response capabilities. XDR provides a unified platform that streamlines the detection, investigation, and response to security incidents, reducing the mean time to detect and respond (MTTD/MTTR) significantly. \nRegulatory Compliance and Risk Mitigation: With the capability to aggregate, analyze, and report security data, XDR supports businesses in meeting compliance standards across different regulatory frameworks. By offering a centralized view and aiding in audit trails and reporting, XDR contributes to minimizing risks associated with non-compliance. This use case ensures that businesses maintain a robust security posture while meeting regulatory requirements, reducing the possibility of fines and reputational damage due to non-compliance.\nCurrent Use Case\nProject Overview\nThis Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the scope of work and deliverables for the implementation of XDR tool at Sirion Labs. The objective of this project is to enhance the security of our endpoints (Laptop/Desktops) ensuring data protection, threat detection, and compliance with regulatory requirements.\nProject Scope\nNo. of Users - 1100\nAssessment and Planning:\nReviewing the existing security infrastructure, identifying gaps, and designing an implementation plan.\nInstallation and Configuration: (We will install the CS sensor on 20 windows machines, 5 Mac and 5 Linux machines, Rest customer will have to deploy using third party tool or GPO. Softcell team will help in troubleshooting if required.)\nDeploying the XDR solution and configuring it to integrate with existing security systems and networks.\nCustomization and Integration: \nTailoring the solution to fit the specific needs of the organization, which may involve custom rule sets, policies, and integration with SIEM, SOAR, or other security tools.\nTesting and Validation: (We will test policies on 20 windows machines, 5 Mac and 5 Linux machines, Rest customer will have to deploy using third party tool or GPO)\nThoroughly testing the XDR solution to ensure it detects, alerts, and responds effectively to security threats.\nOngoing Support and Maintenance: (It is already added from Crowd strike. Customer will have to procure 1 year support services (12 incident Pack) from Softcell if he need softcell support)\nOffering post-implementation support, updates, and maintenance to ensure the continued effectiveness of the XDR solution.\nReporting and Monitoring: \nSetting up reporting mechanisms and monitoring tools to track the performance and efficacy of the XDR solution.\nUser Training and Documentation:\nProvide training to relevant personnel on the proper use of the XDR tool. \nDevelop comprehensive documentation for administrators\nProject Timeline\nThe project is expected to commence on 15th November. The timeline is subject to adjustment based on purchase order released by Procurement Team of Sirion Labs.\nResource Allocation\nPartner and CrowdStrike team will jointly assign a dedicated project team, including a   project manager, specialists, and technical experts .(Kindly Note- There will be dedicated resource from softcell for Project Planning, Documentation coordination, collaboration and implementation.
