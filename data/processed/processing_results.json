Integrator shall ensure that only such of its personnel that have been certified by Jamf in writing as a \u201cJamf Certified Integrator\u201d will provide Services as set forth in Exhibit A and if applicable, Integrator shall ensure that only such of its personnel that have been certified by Jamf in writing as a \u201cJamf Certified Trainer\u201d will provide Services as set forth in Exhibit B. If permitted by local law, Jamf may, from time to time, conduct background and references investigations and verifications, criminal background checks, and Integrator shall, if permitted by local law, ensure that its personnel have consented in writing to allow Jamf to conduct such investigations. \n4.1 Jamf Certified Trainer Requirements. The following requirements are applicable to Integrator\u2019s provision of Services described in Exhibit C.  \n4.1.1  Integrator and its personnel must be in good standing with Jamf.  \n4.1.2 Integrator personnel seeking to become a Jamf Certified Trainer must: (i) attend the appropriate Jamf training course and complete the course receiving certification of 90% or better; (ii) attend and satisfactorily complete a Train the Trainer (T3) program; (iii) assist Jamf in delivering one Jamf offered training course; and (iv) lead delivery of one Jamf offered training course under Jamf\u2019s supervision.

Integrator personnel that become certified to provide a Jamf Certified Training course shall participate in ongoing training that includes re-certification on major course changes, acknowledgment of minor course changes and attendance at Jamf\u2019s \u201cTrain the Trainer (T3)\u201d events. \nJamf offers various levels of training courses for which Integrator may become certified.

Jamf will determine re-certification needs and communicate such needs to Integrator in advance. Recertification may be delivered in person or virtually by Jamf depending on the complexity of change in Jamf\u2019s Software and/or required training coursework. Acknowledgment of minor course changes may occur on a frequent basis. Integrator\u2019s Jamf Certified Trainers are required to acknowledge receipt of updates and may be required to perform a routine examination to verify capability to conduct courses containing minor changes.   \n5.0 Ownership.

        "original_text": "Resale Orders; Appointment.  Reseller may request to resale Products and Services by submitting a written quote request to Salt Security or a Salt Security authorized distributor (\u201cDistributor), which must contain the following information:  (i) the identity of the applicable end user of the Products and Services; (ii) the applicable end user\u2019s business and email addresses; and (iii) the specific Products and Services, applicable volume levels, subscription start date, and subscription length, to be resold to the applicable end user.  All such information must be accurate and complete and must reflect bona fide orders Reseller has received from end users.  Salt Security may accept or reject a quote request, whether from Reseller or a Distributor, in its sole discretion.  Upon Salt Security\u2019s written acceptance of a quote request, Salt Security shall issue to Reseller (or the applicable Distributor) a written quote that identifies the amount Reseller (or Distributor) shall pay to Salt Security in connection with Reseller\u2019s (or Distributor\u2019s) resale of the Products and Services to the end user identified in the applicable quote request and any other terms and conditions in connection therewith (a \u201cQuote\u201d).  Salt Security will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Reseller with a Quote not later than seven days following Salt Security\u2019s acceptance of a quote request.  Reseller (or Distributor) must either accept or reject the Quote in writing within three days following receipt thereof, as set forth in the Quote.  Reseller may accept or reject such Quote in its sole discretion, provided that if Reseller rejects such Quote, Reseller may not resell the Products and Services in connection with the Quote.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, including Salt Security\u2019s written acceptance of a quote request and Reseller\u2019s written acceptance of a Quote (which may be by issuing a purchase order against the Quote, referencing the Quote number, and otherwise matching all information in the Quote), Salt Security authorizes Reseller to resell the Products and Services described in each Order on a nonexclusive basis to the applicable end user specified in the Order, solely for use by such end user in accordance with the terms and conditions of a EULA (as defined below).  Upon Salt Security\u2019s receipt of a purchase order from Reseller, each individual deal will be final and non-cancelable as of the date listed on the purchase order.  The authorization above does not apply to resales to any end user or Products and Services not set forth in an Order.  Salt Security may revise Exhibit\u00a0A to add or delete Products and Services upon 30 days prior written notice to Reseller.  Any revision will apply to all Orders accepted after the effective date of the revision.  For the avoidance of doubt, Reseller shall independently set its own pricing for the Products and Services to each end user.\nDelivery of Credentials.  Subject to Salt Security\u2019s written acceptance of each Order and Reseller\u2019s written acceptance of the applicable Quote, Salt Security will deliver the access credentials needed by the applicable end user to access and use the Products and Services set forth in the applicable Order directly to delivery contact for the end user specified in the applicable Order.  If Salt Security delivers such access credentials to Reseller, Reseller agrees that Reseller shall deliver them directly to the applicable end user and not use or access the Products and Services in any manner.  Reseller shall either delete such access credentials thereafter or maintain them in confidence as Salt Security\u2019s Confidential Information.\nEULAs.  All use of the Products and Services by end users shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Salt Security\u2019s end user license agreement located at https://salt.security/customer-terms-and-conditions (\u201cEULA\u201d). Reseller shall require each end user of the Products and Services to agree in writing to Salt Security\u2019s EULA or otherwise ensure that such end users enter into such EULA in a manner that is legally binding upon the end user. Reseller shall provide evidence of each end user\u2019s acceptance of such end user license agreement to Salt Security upon Salt Security\u2019s request.\nEnforcement Cooperation.  Reseller shall immediately notify Salt Security of any known or suspected breach of any EULAs or other unauthorized use of the Products and Services and shall assist Salt Security in the enforcement of the EULAs.  Reseller shall make Salt Security an express third-party beneficiary of each EULA.\nIdentification as Reseller.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Reseller Agreement, Reseller is permitted to identify Reseller as a Salt Security \u201cReseller\u201d solely in connection with Reseller\u2019s resales of Products and Services.  Reseller may not use any Salt Security trademark, logo, or service mark (\u201cSalt Security Marks\u201d) except pursuant to Salt Security\u2019s then-current trademark usage guidelines and any other guidelines, policies, and instructions provided to Reseller by Salt Security.  Reseller shall submit Salt Security all representations of the Salt Security Marks that Reseller intends to use in connection with the Products and Services, for Salt Security\u2019s approval of design, color, and other details.  If Reseller acquires any goodwill in any of the Salt Security Marks, all such goodwill will automatically vest in Salt Security and Reseller shall take all such actions or execute any documents necessary to affect such vesting.  Reseller shall not contest the validity of any of the Salt Security Marks or Salt Security\u2019s exclusive ownership of the Salt Security Marks.  Reseller shall not adopt, use, or register, whether as a corporate name, trademark, service mark or other indication of origin, any of the Salt Security Marks, or any word or mark confusingly similar to the Salt Security Marks in any jurisdiction.  Reseller shall not remove or efface any proprietary notices on the Products and Services.\nMarketing and Promotion.  Reseller, at Reseller\u2019s own expense, shall:  (i) obtain any licenses, permits, or certifications required in connection with Reseller\u2019s activities under this Agreement; (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its activities under this Agreement to realize maximum resale opportunities for the Products and Services; (iii) conduct its business in a manner that reflects favorably at all times on the Products and Services and Salt Security\u2019s goodwill and reputation; (iv) not make any representations or warranties on Salt Security\u2019s behalf with respect to the Products and Services; and (v) not engage in deceptive, misleading, and illegal practices or representations in connection with the marketing, promotion, and resale of the Products and Services.\nFeedback.  Reseller may have the opportunity to present to Salt Security recommendations or feedback for new features, functionality, or other improvements to the Products and Services (\u201cFeedback\u201d), which Salt Security will consider, at its sole discretion, implementing in future updates to the Products and Services.  The Parties agree that all Feedback is and shall be given voluntarily.  Feedback, even if designated as confidential by Reseller, shall not, absent a separate written agreement, create any confidentiality obligation for Salt Security.  Reseller will not provide Salt Security with any Feedback that Reseller is not authorized or permitted to provide to Salt Security.  Salt Security shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual property rights or otherwise.\nReserved Rights.  Only the end user of the Products and Services may use the Products and Services.  Reseller shall not use any Products and Services resold under this Agreement for Reseller\u2019s own benefit.  Nevertheless, to the extent Reseller gains any access to the Products and Services, all restrictions set forth in the Salt Security EULAs shall apply to such access.  Salt Security retains all right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Products and Services.  No implied right or license is granted by Salt Security to Reseller, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.",

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2, if Reseller is paying a Distributor (rather than Salt Security directly), then this Section 2 shall not apply.\nTaxes.  Reseller shall pay all taxes, duties, costs, and expenses in connection with its resale of the Products and Services, except for taxes based on Salt Security\u2019s net income.  If Reseller is required to pay Salt Security a lower amount under this Agreement because of any withholding tax, Reseller shall pay to Salt Security such grossed-up amount as would be necessary to provide Salt Security the full amount of the amounts due hereunder, absent any withholding tax imposed on amounts payable hereunder.  Reseller shall provide Salt Security with copies of any withholding certificates or documentation supporting Reseller\u2019s withholding of any taxes on amounts due hereunder.\nLate Payments.  Any amount not paid when due hereunder shall be subject to interest at a rate equal to 1.5% of the unpaid amount per month, or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, determined and compounded daily from the due date of such unpaid amount until the date it is paid.  Reseller shall promptly pay to Salt Security any costs of collection (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) in connection with unpaid amounts under this Agreement.\nRecords and Audit.  Reseller shall keep and maintain complete and accurate records of regarding the resale of the Products and Services hereunder and shall allow Salt Security, or its designee, at Salt Security\u2019s expense (except as set forth below) and during office hours and at reasonable intervals, to inspect and make extracts or copies of such records for the purpose of ascertaining Reseller\u2019s compliance with Reseller\u2019s obligations hereunder (an \u201cAudit\u201d).  If an Audit discloses any underpayment by Reseller of amounts actually due hereunder of five percent (5%) or more, Reseller shall pay to Salt Security, not later than 30 days following a receipt of an invoice therefor, (i) the amount of such underpayment and (ii) the costs of such Audit.

Each Party will treat as confidential all Confidential Information of the other Party and will use reasonable efforts not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third-party. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Parties will use at least the same degree of care with respect to the Confidential Information that such Party uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party of any actual or suspected misuse or unauthorized disclosure of the other Party\u2019s Confidential Information. \nFor the purposes of this section, the Party disclosing Confidential Information shall be referred to as the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d and the Party receiving the Confidential Information shall be referred to as the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d.\nExceptions.

Each Party agrees that the specific terms and conditions of this Agreement will be treated as confidential information and that no disclosure thereof will be made in any form without the prior written consent of the other Party, except (i) as required by applicable disclosure laws; (ii) to accountants, banks, financing sources, lawyers and related Parties subject to a duty not to disclose to others; or (iii) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.

If the Disclosing Party is unable to obtain a protective order, the Confidential Information may be disclosed only to the extent necessary under law.\nEither Party is not permitted to discuss the other Party\u2019s affairs with any member of the press and other news media without written authorization from the appropriate authorized representative of such other Party. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any breach of the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Clause shall cause the other party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event of such a breach, the Disclosing Party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce this Agreement in addition to any available legal remedies.\nAll Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party hereunder is provided \"AS IS\" and without warranty of any kind. All Confidential Information shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party.
