Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any waiver, amendment or other modification of this Agreement, will not be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both the Parties.\nEntire Agreement: This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement of the Parties as to the subject matter of this Agreement.

The terms of this Agreement will govern all Services undertaken by Service Provider for FNF India and shall supersede any terms and conditions given anywhere else, either orally or in writing, in connection with the work to be performed under this Agreement.\nSeverability: If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated in any way. Service Provider and FNF India agree to replace any invalid provision with a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent and effect of the invalid provision.\nSuccessors and Assigns: Service Provider shall not assign or transfer any of its obligations, arising from this Agreement. FNF India may, as and when required assign its obligations under this Agreement to any third parties. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding on and for the benefit of the Parties\u2019 assigns and representatives.
